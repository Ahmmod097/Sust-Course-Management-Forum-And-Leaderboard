# Sust-Course-Management-Forum-And-Leaderboard
This is a web application that is made in Django Framework. This application has two type of users that is Student & Teacher. I have used an unique field so that any user can not registered as teacher. The teachers take their code form the super admin who is randomly generated the code and put this code in the  registration form to register as a teacher. The teacher can create any discussion forum but the student cant. The Add button will only visible to teachers while creating the discussion forum. The students can't see this button. 

The Student or Teacher can create a post and comment a post. Other user can give points to any comment (only one time). And based on this points, I make leaderboard to show which user has the maximum contribution in giving answers to various posts.
